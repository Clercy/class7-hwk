#Chart Generation
# I reset my chart generator to create 3 column charts as the 4 column run was very long to run.  After an hour I had only generated 1/4 of the files.  The 3 column generation takes approx. 20 minutes.



#Chart Analysis
#My analysis was based on finding the ideal scenario to raise a family using the following 3 factors: affordability (MEDV), #teaching ratios (PTRATIO) and peace of mind (CRIM).  That is why I targeted the following 3 attributes to help make my decision.

#- CRIM per capita crime rate by town
#- PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town
#- MEDV Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000â€™s

#I struggled with generating various types of charts and came back to the plot and each time the chart would evolve giving me the #one I preferred the most PLT_MEDV_PTRATIO_CRIM_20193719145.png.  Two others that were generated similarly were #PLT_CRIM_PTRATIO_ZN_MEDV_201936174728.png and PLT_CRIM_RAD_MEDV_PTRATIO_201936213828.png.  The last 2 I did not like as much #because as a 4 column chart we were adding unnecessary noise to the analysis.  As I wanted to focus on the 3 attributes mentioned #previously my main choice suited perfectly.

#Adding a chart legend also helped me greatly as it gave me a reference point to facilitate my task.  Based on chart #PLT_MEDV_PTRATIO_CRIM_20193719145.png I think the ideal area of focus would be between respondents 100 to 130 and 310 to 340.  In #this area we have a lower than average PTRATIO along with a below average crime rate and the value of homes are hovering around #the average.
